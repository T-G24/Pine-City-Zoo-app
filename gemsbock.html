                            <h3>GEMSBOCK</h3>
                            <p>The Gemsbok, also known as the Oryx, is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and a distinctive black and white facial pattern.</p>
                            <p>At Pine City Zoo, you can find the Gemsbok in the African Savanna exhibit, located near the main entrance. This area is designed to mimic their natural habitat, providing plenty of open space and shade for these majestic animals.</p>
